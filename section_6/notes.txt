First, get into the directory where the docker-compose file is:
Then type: docker-compose up OR docker-compose up -d (To run it in detached mode)
To stop it, type: docker-compose down AND docker-compose down -v (To also delete the volumes)
(It'll automatically pull and build all the images required, and run the containers)

Remember, this will not work on windows, because we're using bind mounts, for backend logs
and these don't work for windows file paths, only for linux file system paths

type: docker-up --help, in the list you'll see the following option:-
--build: Build images before starting containers.
(eg.: we want to FORCE compose to rebuild the images)

In order to build any of the 'custom' images inside your docker-compose.yaml file, type :-
docker-compose build
This will build the images, and won't start any containers.
